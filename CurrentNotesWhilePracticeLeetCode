Space complexity : auxillary space is better way to compare to algorithms.
                   space complexity of any recursion tree is maximum height.



///////////////////////////coding
BSF uses queue 

// Using the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series
      int sum = (b - a + 1) * (a + b) / 2;
