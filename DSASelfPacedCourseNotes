1. Euclidean Algoritm - An efficient method to compute the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) of two integers.
        Given two numbers a and 𝑏(𝑎 > 𝑏 ), repeatedly subtract b from a or 
  use 𝑎%𝑏 until the remainder is 0. The last non-zero remainder is the GCD.
  static int gcd(int a, int b)
	{
		if(b==0)
			return a;

		return gcd(b, a % b);
	}
